# StringifyComcast

Exercise on basic rest apis using java and string operations.

# i. Required features

The following features have been added.

#### •	For the /stringinate endpoint, for a given input string we need to find the character that occurs most frequently and add that character, along with its number of occurrences to the API response JSON. You decide how to represent this in the JSON response. Ignore white space and punctuation.
#### •	For the stats endpoint, track which string input has been seen the most times. Return this value as the most_popular key in the response JSON.
#### •	For the stats endpoint, track which string input is the longest string to be seen by the server and return as the longest_input_received key in the response JSON.


# ii. Developer Choice feature

#### • Basic Input/Output validations are done
#### • Unit testing is done with Coverage reports.
#### • Functional testing is done with Coverage reports.
#### • Code has been refactored and design has been maintained such that no processing is done at the controller and only performed at the Service layer.
